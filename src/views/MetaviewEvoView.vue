      <p>The Evolution Championship Series represents the largest and longest-running fighting game tournaments in the world.
During the year 2021, the most storied fighting game tournament has been forced to go online due to events that have affected the world.
In an attempt to bring in more eyes onto the fighting game community, they teamed up with Metaview (now FreshCut).</p>
<br/>
<p>I have been tasked to assist in establishing a brand new look for this collaboration. Providing assets for the Metaview app, website, and social media.</p>
